# The tricks of the voting system

The need for opposition coalition stems from the properties of the recent electoral system, the diversity of opposition parties and the game-theoretic properties of human behaviour:

1) the single-round, relative-majority based electoral system introduced in 2011 delegates to parliament the district candidate with the highest support, even if his support is actually below 50%, but the other candidates have even less support individually

2) because of the unity of the right-wing governing parties and the numerosity of the oppositional parties, and without opposition coordination, the latter voters have been naturally divided between their parties for years, so that their voting strength has mostly been below that of the strongest minority voting for the single ruling wing party

3) opposition parties face the 'problem of public goods' from game theory, whereby if they pursue their selfish interests alone, they are more likely to enter parliament and stay afloat, even though they cannot form a government then, furthermore their cohesion is hampered by the fact that in this game the behaviour of one selfish player naturally leads to similar behaviour by others:
* "Under the current rules, if a single party sets up a list, it must get 5 per cent of the vote to get in, two parties 10 per cent, and if more than that, 15 per cent." - an incentive for selfishness
* "only members of the same party who stood on a national list in the previous election and won a mandate could form a parliamentary group" - a condition for staying afloat
* out of 106, "27 (by now 71) seats must be contested in order for the nominating organisation to have a national list" - this will split the vote and everyone else will have to play a selfish game

## Some solutions

Opposition coalition can be complemented, and as mentioned above should be complemented, by electoral coalition, in which voters vote for or against different opposition candidates from district to district according to a pre-agreed rule, but all for the same person in any particular district. This, in addition to inter-party cooperation, will further reduce the number of opposition voters who, because of the natural dispersion of their votes, are not represented in parliament. Such voter aggregation is possible by spreading a rule of thumb by word of mouth, or even by using a phone app.

In 27 (by now 71) of the 106 districts, the local candidates' seats, which are mandatory for the future survival of each party, can be allocated among the parties in such a way that the electoral cooperation of the population is minimal. If the districts are divided into multi-candidate and single-candidate groups, and the latter are distributed among the opposition parties taking into account local popularity data, between 42% and 98% of the districts can (could) be won (0.660 if 2 parties run and with 71 districts obligatory), depending on the flexibility of the opposition parties to allocate single-member districts, in addition to the by-election. If all parties settle for roughly >27 districts, and accept that there are only few districts above 27 that parties can pass on popularity grounds while retaining the right to run on list too, then fewer multi-candidate districts are needed and more districts can be won nationally where government support is otherwise below 50%. It should be added that, under this strategy, the more popular the government is and the more districts it has an absolute majority of >50% in, the easier it is for opposition parties to agree on the allocation of districts they can win.
